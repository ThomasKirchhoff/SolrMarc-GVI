#summary top level wiki page for SolrMarc

= Introduction =

SolrMarc can index your marc records into an Apache SOLR index. It contains an updated version of marc4j that improves handling of UTF-8 characters, is more forgiving of malformed marc data, and can recover from data errors gracefully. The SolrMarc indexer is used by Blacklight (http://projectblacklight.org/) and VuFind (http://www.vufind.org/) but it can also be used as a standalone project.
