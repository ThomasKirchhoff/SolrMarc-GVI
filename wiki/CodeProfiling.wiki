#summary Code profiling performed against r1202.

= Introduction =
This page details some code profiling performed against r1202 of the trunk, built using the VuFind presets.

The dataset used for the import is the USQ catalogue, with Solrmarc altered to stop at a pre-determined record count (usually 1,000 records or 10,000 records).

Before attaching a profiler the dataset was indexed into a fresh index a few times to gauge normal performance: ~130+ records per second.

With a profiler attached to the JVM during CPU profiling the performance drops to about 2 records per second, hence the low dataset of 1,000 records used during the early exploratory benchmarks.
